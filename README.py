Comparison Operators : usually evaluate to true or  false
a.== Equal to e.g a == b
b. != not equal to
c. > greater than a >  b
d. < less than a < b
e. >= greater than or equal to a >= b
f. <= less than or equal to a <= b

Logical Ooerators : combine conditional statements
a. and :: & :: returns true if both conditions are true
b. or :: || :: returns true if one condition is met
c. not :: ! :: reverses the results e.g a !=  b

Assignment Operators : used to assign values to variables
a. = : assign x = 4, y = "Austin"
b. += :add and assign , x += 2 ( x= x +2 )
c. not :: ! :: reverse the results e.g a != b


Identity Operators
a. is : returns true if both



            ## CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS



            ## TYPE CASTING
            this is the process of converting one data type into another
            Explicit type casting (manually)

            to convert to
            integer = int(value to be converted)
            float = float(value to be  converted)
            string = str(value to be converted)
            boolean = bool(value to be converted)
            list = list(value to be converted)
            tuple = tuple(value to be converted)
            set = set(value to be converted)

                ###functions
                -block of code logic or a series of code logic that can return a value or be void.
                -functions in python are defined using the def keyword

                    def functionname():
                        code logic

                -for a function to be executed it has to be invoked/called/python has two groups of functions

1. In built functions :  normally associated with data types
2. Custom functions

### VARIABLE SCOPING
Reference to where a variable can be accessed in a program.
1. LOCAL SCOPE
    variable declared in a local scope will only be accessible within that function.
2. GLOBAL SCOPE
   variable defined in this scope can be accessed anywhere within the file.
3.ENCLOSING SCOPE

when a function is defined within another fumction, the inner function can access variable of the outer function
